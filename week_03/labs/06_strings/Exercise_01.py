'''
You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you
understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.

The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing.
For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate
optional arguments. So sub is required, but start is optional, and if
you include start, then end is optional.

Demonstrate below:
- strip
- replace
- find

Exercise 8.2. There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in Section 8.7.
Read the documentation of this method and write an invocation that counts the number of aâ€™s in
'banana'.

word = 'banana'
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'a':
        count = count + 1
print(count)

'''

word = 'banana'
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'a':
        count = count + 1
print(count)
