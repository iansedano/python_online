Build on Exercise_03 from the section on Objects, Classes and Methods.
Create subclasses of two of the existing classes. Create a subclass of
one of those so that the hierarchy is at least three levels.

Build these classes out like we did in Exercise_03.

If you cannot think of way to build on your Exercise_03 classes you can
start from scratch here.

We encourage you to be creative and try to think of an example of
your own for this exercise but if you are stuck, some ideas include:

    - A Vehicle superclass, with Truck and Motorcycle subclasses.
    - A Restaurant superclass, with Gourmet and FastFood subclasses.
