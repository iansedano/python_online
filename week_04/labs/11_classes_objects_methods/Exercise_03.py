'''
- Write a script with three classes that model everyday objects.
- Each class should have an __init__ method that sets attributes
    to a default value if values are not passed.
- Create at least two objects of each class using the __init__ method.
- Each object should have at least three attributes.
- Each class should have at least two class attributes.
- Create a print method in each class that prints out the attributes
    in a nicely formatted string.
- Include a __str__ method in each class.
- Overload the + operator in one of the classes
    so that it adds two attributes of that class.
- Once the objects are created, change some of the attribute values.

Be creative. Have some fun. Using objects you can model anything you want.
Cars, animals, poker games, sports teams, trees, beers, people and so on.
