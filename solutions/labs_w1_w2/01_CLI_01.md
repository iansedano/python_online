# Fundamentals Exercise 1: CLI

Perform the following tasks using the CLI and copy and paste the commands and results below.

- Navigate to your home directory

        $ cd

- Create a new directory called CodingNomads. We will use this folder to house materials for the course.

        $ mkdir CodingNomads

- Move into the CodingNomads folder

        $ cd CodingNomads

- Create new folder cli_testing

        $ mkdir cli_testing

- Inside of folder cli_testing,

    a. print the directory path

        $ pwd

        /Users/Martin/CodingNomads/cli_testing

    b. create 3 new .txt files all with different names (file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt)

        $ touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

    c. list the contents of the folder

        $ ls

        file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

    d. rename one of the files

        $ mv file1.txt wow.txt

- Inside of folder cli_testing, create a new folder

        $ mkdir new_folder

- Copy a file from cli_testing to the new folder

        $ cp file2.txt new_folder

- Move a different file from cli_testing to the new folder

        $ mv file3.txt new_folder/file3.txt

- Demonstrate removing:

    a. A file (file3.txt)

        $ rm file3.txt

    b. A folder (new_folder)

        $ rm -rf new_folder

        NOTE: $ rmdir does not work on folders which have files in them

## vim

a. Use $ vim to write some text inside a file

    $ vim

    - press "i" for "insert mode"
    - write text, e.g. "get me out of here!"
    - press "esc" to enter "normal mode"
    - type ":w my_file.txt" to save the file
    - type ":q" to quit vim
    - NOTE: you can also create a file already with its filename by opening vim with a filename specified

b. Use $ cat print contents of file

    $ cat my_file.txt

    get me out of here!

c. Use $ grep to search for a word inside file

    $ grep here my_file.txt

    here

d. Create another file using vim, name it hello.txt and add some text

    $ vim hello.txt

    - press "i" for "insert mode"
    - enter text:
        "how?!
        tell me how!"
    - press "esc" to enter "normal mode"
    - type ":wq" to save the text and quit vim

## explore advanced CLI

- What is the difference between the two commands > and >>?

\> overwrites the content of a file with new input, while >> appends to the file

- Append the text "how?!" of hello.txt to my_file.txt

        $ grep how\?! hello.txt >> my_file.txt

        NOTE: the "?" needs to be escaped using the backslash character, or wrapped inside of quotes.

- Overwrite the content of my_file.txt with "tell me"

        $ grep -o "tell me" hello.txt > my_file.txt

        NOTE: the flag -o only takes the matched portion of the line. See more:

        $ grep "tell me" hello.txt > my_file.txt

        NOTE: the above results in overwriting the file with the whole line "tell me how!"
        This is because $ grep takes the whole line(s) where the search term matches as output. See more:
