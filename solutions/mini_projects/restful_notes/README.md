# Build a simple API

In this mini-project we will use the Django framework to build a simple
API that handles CRUD operations for notes in a RESTful way.

Follow the the tutorial [here](https://codeburst.io/create-a-django-api-in-under-20-minutes-2a082a60f6f3),
but keep in mind that it has been written for an older version of Django.

Notable updates:
- Use `path()` instead of `url()` for registering URLs
- When using Postman, you will have to *remember the trailing slash*
(Your browser might autocomplete it in case you forget it)

Also: watch your python **indentation** when creating the `Notes` class.

Have fun, and get ready to serve your notable wisdom with the world ;)
