# clirpg - a CLI-RPG

Use classes and methods to create a text based command-line interface role playing game.

Digital dice included! ðŸŽ²

I'm sending you off by yourself on this one, on your journey of discovery.
Be brave! And **use internet resources!** (and stay away from the dark web... ;)

# Requirements

This game can be as complex as you want to, but at minium it should include:
* a player
* multiple opponents
* a way for the player to interact with the opponents
* changing outcomes of those interactions, depending both on chance as well as attributes of the player/opponents

Let your imagination go wild! :)

# Notes

This is a great example for modeling different **classes** (e.g. the `player`
will be of a different class than an `opponent`), to drill the concept of
**instances** (e.g. you'll create multiple instances of opponents from the same
class), as well as for **methods** - the "abilities" that are unique to a class
and that therefore are also available to each instance of that class.
