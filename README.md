### Contributing

There is always room for improvement for our material, and as a budding
software developer, learning to contribute to a project is a great first
step e.g. to get into open-source. Therefore remember:


**We appreciate `pull` requests!**


If you don't yet know what that means, no worries! Either come back later,
or read the links below. Basically, it's easy:


If you **find a typo**, or a **mistake in the code** - or you **want to add an
exercise of your own for other students to learn from** - you can add
these improvements to the original repository.

a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
