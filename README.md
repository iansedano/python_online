## Fork me!

After you have created a GitHub account, press the "Fork" symbol at the
top right of this repository. It looks like this:

![Fork repo](media/fork.png)

This will create **your own copy** of all the files on your personal GitHub
profile. You can then use the repo to practice pushing to and pulling from
a remote repo, edit files locally when you complete the exercises, and
keeping your personal changes under version control.

### Contributing

There is always room for improvement for our material, and as a budding
software developer, learning to contribute to a project is a great first
step e.g. to get into open-source. Therefore remember:


**We appreciate `pull` requests!**


If you don't yet know what that means, no worries! Either come back later,
or read the links below. Basically, it's easy:


If you **find a typo**, or a **mistake in the code** - or you **want to add an
exercise of your own for other students to learn from** - you can add
these improvements to the original repository.


Check out how to [create a branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) and how to [create a pull request from
a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
