        float - 3.1

5 - What is a variable?

        a variable is a value that varies.

        i.e.

        class = 3
        and = 'im illegal'

8 - What are keywords and what are they used for?

        keywords are reserved words, they are used for basic operations and cannot be variable names.  For example, if and else.

9 - What are operators and what are they used for?

        + - * / > <  -  for performing maths or comparing or logical

10 - Use the interpretor to demonstrate the use of some of the operators. Give the input and output of addition, multiplication and exponentiation.

        1 + 1
        2 - 1
        3 * 2
        2 ** 2

11 - What is floor division? How does Python 3 handle floor division?

        returns the result of division as a whole number.
        i.e
            >>> 15 / 4 # normal division
            3.75

            3

12 - What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

        expression evaluates to a value

        >>>my_value = 5 + 4 ** 2

        statement performs an action

        >>>print(my_value)

        That said, a few stack overflow discussions claim that expressions are a type of statement. That expressions are parts of statements.

        for example, an expression statement

        >>> print(5*5)


13 - What is the order of operations?

        Brackets first
        Multiplication
        division
        addition
        subtraction
