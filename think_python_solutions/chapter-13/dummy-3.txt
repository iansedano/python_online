The history of Lithuania between 1219 and 1295 covers the establishment and early history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the first Lithuanian state. In 1219, twenty-one Lithuanian dukes signed a peace treaty with Galicia–Volhynia – the first proof that the Baltic tribes were uniting. Despite continuous warfare with two Christian orders, the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Knights, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was established and gained some control over neighbouring lands that were vulnerable after the collapse of Kievan Rus'. Mindaugas (modern commemorative coin pictured) was crowned as King of Lithuania in 1253 and is traditionally regarded as the founder of the state. However, in 1261, he broke the peace with the Livonian Order, and his assassination in 1263 by Treniota ended the early Christian kingdom in Lithuania. It was a pagan empire for the next 120 years, fighting against the Teutonic and Livonian Orders during the Northern Crusades. After Mindaugas' death, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania entered times of relative instability but did not disintegrate. Vytenis assumed power in 1295, and during the next twenty years laid solid foundations for the Duchy to expand and grow. (Full article...)
