* any_lowercase1

This seems to work as advertised, but is brittle, since it will choke on whitespace chars, such as tabs, and return false.

* any_lowercase2

This will always return true, since it will only work with 'c' as specified in the if statement.

* any_lowercase3

This will return the last character in lowercase, since the for loop will cycle through all of them, but only return the value once complete.

* any_lowercase4

This will return either 'False' or 'True' if the c is a lowercase.

* any_lowercase5

This will immediately return False if any character is lowercase, True if it is all uppercase.
